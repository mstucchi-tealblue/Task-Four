# Task-Four

Each card has two states, "popped" and the default one "". "Popped" is triggered when a click on the card happens. From "popped" to the default "" another click is necessary.
The main has three states, "single1", "single2" and the default one "". The single1 is triggered when the card1 is in the "popped" state, it makes the other card disappear. Same logic for single2.
